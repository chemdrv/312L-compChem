    "The time it takes computers to do the calculations involved in computational chemistry spans orders of magnitude. For simple calculations on small molecules, a reasonably new laptop can do them in a few seconds. For high precision calculations on hundreds (or thousands) of atoms, a super-computer might need weeks. This guides choices in how a scientist might choose to interact with their software.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're doing simple calculations on small molecules. You could honestly set up this entire software stack to run locally. I'm not asking you to do it, because the installation is finicky. So I've set us up with ChemCompute, which has both a **lot** of compute capacity and exactly the software stack we're looking for. I'm also having you work in Jupyter notebooks, because I like how accessable they are for students.\n",

    "(If you want to install things locally, Psi4 has directions on their website, but you'll want WSL if you run Windows.

    "But Psi4, the computational package we're working with, is research grade, and can span the range to really intense calculations. If you look through their website, or the resources MolSSI (https://education.molssi.org/resources.html) has for learning quantum chemistry, you'll see entirely different ways of interacting with the Psi4 package, that are more appropriate for research level uses."

    "For some calculations, the point group of the molecule doesn't matter. The energy is the energy, no big deal. But, in order to calculate normal modes and properly assign them in a spectrum, we need to have a molecule that's in the right point group. We run into a funny problem here: rounding errors and sig figs. Think about the shape of methane in your head right now: it's a carbon in the middle, two hydrogens pointing out this way, two hydrogens pointing out the other side. In your head, you've defined it with exact angles. The computer projects this into cartesian coordinates. In the limit of infinite decimal places, these two representations are exactly the same thing: you project the angles into cartesian space and it's fine. But, once you round off, you can introduce a smidge of error. Similarly, if the computer is following an algorithm to relax a geometry to a minimum, it might relax this hydrogen a smidge this way and the next one a smidge another way. You and I both know that 1.082323 and 1.082324 are the same for all intents and purposes. But *technically* they're not the same bond length. If your molecule has those two bond lengths, then those bonds aren't symmetric. There are methods to tell Psi4 to chill with the decimal places, but I've had difficiulty always getting it to return the correct symmetry.\n",
